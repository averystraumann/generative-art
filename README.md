# generative-art

making generative art using processing! to see the drawings, i have video/photo demos in each of their respective folders, or if you have the processing software downloaded you can download the source code and run it yourself. i also added an executable in some of the folders, but there were some issues with them so they may not work.

recursive tree: uses a recursive algorithm to draw a branching tree; get different results by changing the angle and the initial branch length

julia set: draws the julia fractal! see wiki for more detailed info on the julia set: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set

mandelbrot: draws the mandelbrot fractal!! uses basically the same code as the julia set drawings, as julia is basically a zoomed in version of mandelbrot. see wiki for more detailed info on mandelbrot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set
