here are some examples of the mandelbrot drawings made with this source code! to try it yourself, download the processing software and the source code in this 
file, and change the last 4 inputs in the pixel2Complex call on line 40 of the mandelbrot file. this essentially changes the region of the complex plane you
are using to do the calculations :) these examples all use different regions of the complex plane, and are listed in the order of the left boundary, right 
boundary, bottom boundary, and top boundary of the region used
